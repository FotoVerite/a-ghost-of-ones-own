        I've been waking up more and more reaching for someone, anyone and
        finding that space empty. I used to think it was Matt I was reaching
        for. But I don't even know. Maybe it's not a person, just the feeling of
        a boundary, between me and the darkness. Oh god what does that even
        fucking me. Even alone my pretentiousness lashes out and confounds
        simplicity.

        I don't know if I'm lonely, I'm used to being alone. So when I reach
        out, send a arm over to the side of me, I don't expect him to be there.
        But I want someone to be there. I want to be worth that to someone. I
        want to be worth staying around for. And I've been doubting that. That
        I'm just a break for most guys. Something easy, asking little, meaning
        even less.

        Always... always I come back to what other people want. it's like I'm
        just an empty space looking for how best to contain myself for the
        person coming through. Hyper-analyze what I say, how I walk, how I reach
        out and kiss them.
